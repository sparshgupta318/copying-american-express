Web Programming with Python and JavaScript
I tried to copy the american express website. It took me a lot of time as i am not that good in design but i learnt of the things .Home page is the main similarity of the website.In this i have main page,My account page,Login page and Contact us page.
I also tried to make it mobile responsive.But by applying these i become more confident in css ,html and mainly bootstrap.
